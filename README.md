<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Video Player][ <img src="" alt="Logo" width="80" height="80">]](https://example.com)

There are already a lot of video players in the web, I know. But this idea came from create one by my own and add some features inside like my own logo, some singular design, my own costumized features. That resource takes a great place in a world where e-learning and online courses are getting more usual and  and homepages owners wants the most  sigunlar version  of their webpage. This is an open-source project then feel free to fork , copy , use it with commercial reasons or not.  If that project was util for you i would apreciate  if you  let a  start here.

Here's why:<br>
⚫  World is getting more e-learning friendly besides use a customized video player with  your own features and brand make your business webpage more singular.<br>

⚫  As an open-source project it will always be able for new features , it is always envolving.<br>

Of course, no one component will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. 

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With<br>

⚫  Vanila Java Script <br>

..... and  love :heart:
